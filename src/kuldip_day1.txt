React Task (Day 1)
1. JSX
JSX stand for javascript XML
It allow us to write html in react and also easier to write and add.
We dont need to use createElement()  or appendChild() methods.
It converts HTML tags into react elements.
In this we write expressions into {} braces. The expression can be a React variable, or property, or any other valid JavaScript expression.
The HTML code must be wrapped in ONE top level element.(like in div element).
JSX will throw an error if the HTML is not correct, or if the HTML misses a parent element.
For use more tags in components and to wrap multiple lines we use fragment (<> and </>) for it.
In jsx we use ClassName instead of class attribute as class is already reserved word in Javascript.S

2. Real Dom
In real dom updation is slow.
In this we can update HTML directly.
We need to create new DOM if elements updates.
DOM manipulation is very expensive.
In real DOM memory wastage is high as it required new DOM everytime.
3. Virtual Dom
In virtual dom updation is fast.
In this we can not update HTML directly.
We need to update JSX if element updates.
DOM manipulation is very easy.
In virtual DOM memory wastage is low.
